# Ready-to-use Preact starter kit

This project contains the basic config for using the following set of tools pre-configured altogether:
- webpack
- babel
- preact
- eslint
- prettier
- vscode

You can use this repository the same way you would use create-react-app except it's based on preact. It does not contain config for CSS, be free to add any style system that you wish (css loader, sass loader, styled components...)

This repository would not exist without the help of the following articles (kudos to the authors !):
